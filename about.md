<p>Hey! Thanks for taking a look at my website! I am a recent Mathematics graduate from the University of Warwick, currently on a year out of higher education due to the COVID-19 pandemic. My major academic interests lie in statistical inference, machine learning and other areas of statistics/applied maths, leading me to look for MSc programmes in Mathematical Sciences/Statistics/Machine Learning for the 2021/22 academic year. As an aspiring machine learner, I will be using this blog to talk about my personal projects, subtleties/unintuitive concepts in various stats/ML/DL topics & packages and anything else interesting that I've read about in my own time!</p>

<p>Feel free to check out my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/rushilg99">respositories!</a> At the time of writing, I have 2 repos; one of which is concerned with Bayesian inference and the use of MCMC to approximate posterior distributions, whilst the other concerns the use of past cricketers' batting statistics in order to "predict" batting averages of cricketers who made their debut in the last decade (2010-2020). I will be uploading more code and other projects over time.</p>
